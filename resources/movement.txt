player in cave, dont know what is up. it sees the nearest 9 meshes around it, and if he jumps, he connects to it and uses its gravity. you can walk up the walls if they connect within the "9 tile" radius.

find player position
set all voxels in a specified range around player, which arent generated, and set its samplex value

get the absolute value from x-128


child should only collide with terrain, not with parent. 
on all collisions, we invert the ray i have now, and point it to the place where the collision first happened. there, we find the normal off of the ground, and add this to our calculation(maybe weighted based on the distance).

scrap capsule, go with ray to ground
find out how 

make it into deja vu meme
